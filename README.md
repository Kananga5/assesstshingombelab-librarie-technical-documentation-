Circuits and switches addresses AC Science Understanding ACSSU097 Electrical energy can be transferred and transformed in electrical circuits and can be generated from a range of sources, through the context of simple electrical circuits and their components.
Circuits and switches provides students with hands-on opportunities to: 
•	construct and represent simple circuits
•	investigate how changing the components of a simple circuits affects how it works
•	explore different sources of energy that may generate electricity
•	examine the role of switches in a simple circuit
Students apply their new learning by: 
•	planning and conducting an investigation into the function of the components of a simple circuit and designing, making and evaluating a circuit that transforms energy from one form to another
Linking science with literacy 
In the Primary Connections approach, students are supported to create representations that draw on and strengthen their literacy development. In Circuits and switches, students represent and explain their understanding about how electrical energy can be transferred and transformed in electrical circuits and can be generated from a range of sources, by creating these representations:
•	Analogy
•	Annotated diagram
•	Biography
•	Circuit diagram
•	Cutaway diagram
•	Factual text
•	Glossary
•	Ideas map
•	Procedural text
•	TWLH chart
•	Word wall

Scientific investigations involve posing questions, testing predictions, collecting and interpreting evidence and, drawing conclusions and communicating findings. When scientists plan and conduct a fair test investigation it is to answer a question or test a prediction. Students emulate this in the classroom as they continue to develop their science inquiry skills.

This qualification does not replace any other qualification and is not replaced by any other qualification. 

PURPOSE AND RATIONALE OF THE QUALIFICATION 
Purpose: 
The Bachelor of Education Honours Degree in Technology Education is intended to prepare learners for research based Postgraduate study in the field of Technology Education. This will serve to consolidate and deepen the Educator's expertise in Technology Education and develop research capacity in the methodology and techniques in this area. This qualification will demand a high level of intellectual independence and theoretical engagement thus preparing the learner for access to further study for a Master's Degree. 

Rationale: 
The School community in general recognises the importance of providing a Postgraduate qualification in Technology Education, a field of study in which there is a great scarcity of teachers with professional knowledge and expertise as well as leadership skills to promote this area of study at school level.

INTERNATIONAL COMPARABILITY 
International comparability has been conducted with qualifications from institutions in the United Kingdom and Australia. 

University of Glasgow offers a Bachelor Technology Education. The structure of Honours qualifications in the United Kingdom is different from ours. This is a four-year qualification from which learners exit with an Honours Degree. The qualification focus on preparing teachers' understand of how children learn, as well as appropriate technological subjects such as Electronics, Design, Mechanics, Materials, Energy and Graphics. They also study practical-based subjects so that they can successfully deliver the range of vocational courses encompassed by Technological Education. 

University of Strathclyde - United Kingdom (UK): 
The University's mission in the Bachelor of Education Honours Degree is to pursue excellence in research, knowledge exchange and education to the benefit of learners, staff and wider society. The qualification helps learners to generate new ideas, knowledge, skills and approaches in teaching and learning that enable individuals and society to succeed in an increasingly complex technological age and to do so with a social conscience. 

The University of Technology Sydney in Australia offers a four year Bachelor of Arts: Education (Honours). Through this qualification learners continually develop teaching competence throughout the Degree with a comprehensive and practical engaging professional experience programme. It provides graduates with advanced knowledge of Teacher Education and Research. Graduates undertake a scholarly piece of work, working with an academic supervisor and representing the research community in educational settings. 

Most subjects are delivered in blended mode. Learners study innovative teaching methods in the key learning areas and explore contemporary issues and applications, including technology-enhanced learning and learning analytics. Learners undertake professional teaching experience totalling 80 days of supervised teaching practice in schools. 

Conclusion: 
The qualification compares with these international qualifications in terms of purpose and the focus on technology in teaching and learning. The qualifications also have a strong focus on research in which the technology aspect is tailored.

UNIT STANDARD NOTES 
Notes to assessors: 

Assessors should keep the following general principles in mind when designing and conducting assessments against this unit standard: 
•	Focus the assessment activities on gathering evidence in terms of the main outcome expressed in the title to ensure assessment is integrated rather than fragmented. Remember we want to declare the person competent in terms of the title. Where assessment at title level is unmanageable, then focus assessment around each specific outcome, or groups of specific outcomes. 
•	Make sure evidence is gathered across the entire range, wherever it applies. Assessment activities should be as close to the real performance as possible, and where simulations or role-plays are used, there should be supporting evidence to show the candidate is able to perform in the real situation. 
•	Do not focus the assessment activities on each assessment criterion. Rather make sure the assessment activities focus on outcomes and are sufficient to enable evidence to be gathered around all the assessment criteria. 
•	The assessment criteria provide the specifications against which assessment judgements should be made. In most cases, knowledge can be inferred from the quality of the performances, but in other cases, knowledge and understanding will have to be tested through questioning techniques. Where this is required, there will be assessment criteria to specify the standard required. 
•	The task of the assessor is to gather sufficient evidence, of the prescribed type and quality, as specified in this unit standard, that the candidate can achieve the outcomes again and again and again. This means assessors will have to judge how many repeat performances are required before they believe the performance is reproducible. 
•	All assessments should be conducted in line with the following well documented principles of assessment: appropriateness, fairness, manageability, integration into work or learning, validity, direct, authentic, sufficient, systematic, open and consistent.

Abstract
This paper proposes a GateRL that is an automated circuit design framework of CMOS logic gates based on reinforcement learning. Because there are constraints in the connection of circuit elements, the action masking scheme is employed. It also reduces the size of the action space leading to the improvement on the learning speed. The GateRL consists of an agent for the action and an environment for state, mask, and reward. State and reward are generated from a connection matrix that describes the current circuit configuration, and the mask is obtained from a masking matrix based on constraints and current connection matrix. The action is given rise to by the deep Q-network of 4 fully connected network layers in the agent. In particular, separate replay buffers are devised for success transitions and failure transitions to expedite the training process. The proposed network is trained with 2 inputs, 1 output, 2 NMOS transistors, and 2 PMOS transistors to design all the target logic gates, such as buffer, inverter, AND, OR, NAND, and NOR. Consequently, the GateRL outputs one-transistor buffer, two-transistor inverter, two-transistor AND, two-transistor OR, three-transistor NAND, and three-transistor NOR. The operations of these resultant logics are verified by the SPICE simulation.

1. Introduction
Over the past decade, machine learning (ML) algorithms, especially deep learning (DL) approaches, have attracted lots of interests in a variety of applications, such as image classification [1], object detection [2], image/video search [3], super resolution [4], language translation [5], speech recognition [6], stock market prediction [7], and so on, due to their dramatic advances, along with highly increased processing power and huge amount of training datasets [8].
Besides, there have also been many ML-related research studies on the field of the circuit design [9]. One direction is to implement ML networks in existing or specialized hardware platforms. While various simplification methods have been proposed to alleviate the requirement on processing power and data bandwidth [10,11,12], highly complicated and large size DL networks have been realized based on specialized integrated circuit solutions, such as tensor processing units (TPUs) [13] and general purposed graphics processing units (GPGPUs) [14] that enable the acceleration of DL computations. The other approach is to employ ML algorithms during the course of the integrated circuit design. ML methods optimize transistors’ sizes of a given circuit schematic in various points of view of target performances, including power consumption, bandwidth, gain, and area [15,16]. At the layout stage, MLs automate the placement procedure to avoid the routing errors in advance for the small chip area [17,18]. These approaches lead to the substantial reduction on the overall design time by the much smaller number of iterations in simulation and layout stages. In particular, a Berkeley analog generator (BAG) has been studied as the designer-oriented framework since 2013 [19,20]. BAG contains the whole circuit design procedures, including schematic, layout, and verification. Its schematic design platform selects one architecture for a given specification and optimizes parameters. The DL-based layout optimization for a BAG framework was also proposed in 2019 [21].
On the other hand, to the best of our knowledge, there have been no research results to devise DL to design the circuit structure from the scratch at the transistor level. These circuit structure generators cannot avoid very large hypothesis space because a transistor have three terminals of source, gate, and drain that can be connected to each other and used as input, output, or internal node. As a result, it is much more difficult to give rise to the custom schematic directly than to use given circuit blocks that have dedicated ports for inputs and outputs. This paper proposes an automated schematic design framework (GateRL) for digital logic gates, such as inverter, buffer, NAND, AND, NOR, and OR, at the backplane of complementary metal on semiconductor (CMOS) transistors. This full custom design scheme is required for special circuits in the situation with limitations, such as thin-film transistor (TFT) shift registers integrated in display panels, where only one-type TFTs are allowed [22,23,24,25]. While most off-the-shelf applications have been based on the supervised learning networks trained with a huge amount of data and labels, the GateRL employs the reinforcement learning (RL) [26] because the schematic design is difficult to provide labels and only whether the resultant circuit works or not can be decided. The remaining parts are organized as follows. In Section 2, the proposed GateRL is explained in detail by addressing overall architecture and variables exchanged between agent and environment. Section 3 demonstrates the experimental results that include the schematics proposed by the GateRL and their simulation results by simulation program with integrated circuit emphasis (SPICE). Section 4 concludes this paper.
2. Proposed GateRL Architecture
A proposed GateRL system is based on the RL methodology that consists of agent and environment, as shown in Figure 1. While the agent sends an action (𝑎𝑡
) to the environment to add a new connection to the schematic, the environment updates state (𝑆𝑡+1), reward (𝑟𝑡+1), and mask (𝑀𝑡+1
) and transfers them to the agent again. Unlike general RL networks, the GateRL makes use of the action masking scheme to take into account several constraints in the circuit design, as well as to reduce the size of the action space [27]. The target logic gate is specified by the truth table (T), where corresponding outputs are described over all the combinations of inputs.
Figure 1. Proposed GateRL block diagram. 
2.1. State (𝑆𝑡
)
𝑆𝑡
is extracted from the connection matrix (CM) that is similar to an adjacency matrix of a graph theory [28]. As depicted in Figure 2, all possible nodes of the schematic are equally assigned to columns and rows of CM, leading to the shape of a square matrix. 𝑁𝑖, 𝑁𝑜, 𝑁𝑛, and 𝑁𝑝 are the numbers of inputs, outputs, n-type MOS (NMOS) transistors, and p-type MOS (PMOS) transistors, respectively. Therefore, the total number of columns or rows (𝑁𝐶𝑀) can be obtained by Equation (1). The first two columns and two rows represent connections to supply voltage sources of VDD and GND. In particular, because transistors have three terminals of source (S), gate (G), and drain (D), the numbers of their nodes are calculated by means of the product of the number of transistors and the factor of 3. The connections of their body terminals are omitted by assuming that bodies of all NMOS and PMOS transistors are fixed at GND and VDD, respectively. From here, the node assigned to the i-th row or column is addressed as the node i (𝑖=1,2,…,𝑁𝐶𝑀). 
𝑁𝐶𝑀=2+𝑁𝑖+𝑁𝑜+3𝑁𝑛+3𝑁𝑝.

Figure 2. Connection matrix (CM) configuration. 
An element of CM at i-th row and j-th column (𝑐𝑚𝑖𝑗
) is assigned to 0 or 1, where 0 means no connection, and 1 indicates the connection between two corresponding nodes as expressed in Equations (2) and (3). Therefore, the circuit schematic can be extracted from a given CM. For example, CM of Figure 3a is converted into the schematic of Figure 3b, where 𝑁𝑖, 𝑁𝑜, 𝑁𝑛, and 𝑁𝑝 are 1, 1, 1, and 0. In addition, since all the connections in the circuit schematic are undirected, CM is constructed as a symmetric matrix.

Figure 3. Example of schematic extraction from a given CM. (a) Example CM. (b) Extracted schematic. 
In the connection of circuit elements, there exist constraints on CM. Firstly, direct connections between VDD, GND, inputs, and outputs must not be allowed to avoid shoot-through currents between voltages sources and to guarantee the functionality of outputs according to the combinations of inputs. Thus, the corresponding area of CM is always filled with 0. Secondly, the self-connections described by diagonal elements have no meaning in the circuit, leading to the diagonal elements (𝑐𝑚𝑖𝑖,𝑖=1,2,…,𝑁𝐶𝑀
) fixed at 0 all the time. Thirdly, as CM is a symmetric matrix, the full matrix can be reconstructed from the half area over the diagonal. As a result, the whole CM can be represented with the area marked in Figure 4 that is reshaped into 𝑆𝑡 in a form of a vector by flattening. Its length (𝑁𝑠) is calculated as Equation (4) that is derived by dividing the region into a rectangular part and a triangular part. 
𝑁𝑠=(2+𝑁𝑖+𝑁𝑜)(3𝑁𝑛+3𝑁𝑝)+(3𝑁𝑛+3𝑁𝑝−1)(3𝑁𝑛+3𝑁𝑝)2=3(𝑁𝑛+𝑁𝑝)(3𝑁𝑛+3𝑁𝑝+2(2+𝑁𝑖+𝑁𝑜)−1)2=3(𝑁𝑛+𝑁𝑝)(𝑁𝐶𝑀+𝑁𝑖+𝑁𝑜+1)2.

Figure 4. State definition. Because a symmetric CM does not allow self-connection, as well as connections between VDD, GND, inputs, and outputs, the marked area contains the whole information for CM. They are flattened into a state vector (𝑠𝑡
). 
2.2. Mask (𝑀𝑡
)
In addition to three above constraints, the proposed algorithm defines two more constraints that can be applied during schematic design steps. The first one is that VDD, GND, and inputs should not be connected to each other through a single transistor. This connection causes the short circuit situation between voltage sources. Thus, any two nodes among them must not be connected to source and drain terminals of the same transistor, respectively. For example, whenever VDD is linked to the source of a transistor, GND and inputs cannot be placed at its drain. The second constraint is that the connection of a single signal to both source and drain of a transistor is not allowed. Because this connection can be replaced with a simple short circuit, that transistor is not necessary. 
𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑗={0,1,if available connection between node 𝑖 and node𝑗if prohibited connection between node 𝑖 and node 𝑗.
(5) 
In the first place, a masking matrix (MM) is generated with respect to the current CM. MM is also the square matrix of 𝑁𝐶𝑀×𝑁𝐶𝑀
where each element (𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑗
) of 0 or 1 represents whether that connection is available or not, respectively as described in Equation (5). Four masking criteria are reflected on MM as follows. First, since it is not necessary to repeat existing connections, corresponding elements of MM are set to be 1. Second, all direct connections between VDD, GND, inputs, and outputs are blocked. When a node is connected to one of VDD, GND, inputs, and outputs, that node must not be connected to any others of them. Therefore, elements of those short connections are also marked as 1 in MM. Third, when one of source and drain terminals is connected to VDD or GND or inputs, the other terminal of the same transistor must avoid the connection to VDD, GND, and inputs that brings about the drastic shoot-through currents between voltage sources via the transistor turned on. Fourth, it is forbidden to connect a single signal to both source and drain of a transistor. When one of source and drain is connected to a signal, its other terminal should not be assigned to the same signal.
From the second to the fourth, all possible connections via other nodes are simultaneously blocked. In the circuit, the connection of two nodes through different nodes is equal to their direct connection. Therefore, whenever 𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑗
is set to 1, it is checked out whether that corresponding i-th row and j-th column include multiple 1s at CM. If so, all connections between nodes linked to node i and node j are taken into account as the connected ones and then, corresponding elements of MM are set to 1. Finally, after MM is updated by processing four resultant matrixs through logical OR operation, 𝑀𝑡 is generated in a vector form, like 𝑆𝑡, by flattening the upper right region of MM. The overall procedure of the mask generation is closely explained in Figure 5, where 𝑁𝑖, 𝑁𝑜, 𝑁𝑛, and 𝑁𝑝
are 1, 1, 1, and 1.
Figure 5. Mask generation scheme. Based on a given CM, MM is generated according to four masking criteria. The red 1s of matrices in the middle are existing connections in CM, and the blue 1s are possible connections via other nodes for each masking criterion. Finally, two vectors of 𝑆𝑡
and 𝑀𝑡
are produced by flattening the upper right regions of CM and MM, respectively. 
2.3. Reward (𝑟𝑡
)
Since the proposed GateRL simply defines 𝑟𝑡
as +1 for the correctly working schematic and −1 for others, it is expected that the GateRL proposes the working schematics with the minimum number of connection steps, that is, the minimum number of transistors. Therefore, it is of the most importance to verify whether the schematic represented by CM meets a given truth table or not. For example, the truth table of an inverter regarding CM of 𝑁𝑖=2 and 𝑁𝑜=1 consists of four rows that include combinations of two inputs (𝐼𝑁1, 𝐼𝑁2) and their target outputs (𝑂𝑈𝑇) as illustrated in Figure 6. Even though the inverter has only two cases of −1 and +1 for 𝐼𝑁1, the four-row truth table is composed for the agent to be able to support other two-input logic gates, such as AND, NAND, OR, and NOR, with a common GateRL framework. The high level of VDD and the low level of GND are described as +1 and −1, respectively. 0 indicates the high impedance that is equivalent to a floating node without any connections. The second column filled with 0 describes that the second input (𝐼𝑁2
) is not in use for this one-input logic gate.
Figure 6. Truth table for an inverter circuit. Because it is an one-input gate, 𝐼𝑁2
is kept at high impedance by assigning 0, where +1 is VDD, and −1 is GND. 
The verification is conducted with the assumption that CMOS transistors are ideal switches where NMOS and PMOS are completely turned on at gate values of +1 and −1, respectively. The following steps are repeated over from the first row to the last one of a given truth table. First, a vector (𝑆𝑉
) of the size of 3𝑁𝑛+3𝑁𝑝 is initialized with elements of 0. Because its elements describe the voltage levels at terminals of transistors, initial nodes are set to be high impedance nodes. Second, for terminals connected to VDD and GND in the current CM, corresponding elements of 𝑆𝑉 are updated by +1 and −1, respectively. Third, for terminals linked to inputs, corresponding elements in 𝑆𝑉 are updated by input levels at the selected row of the truth table. The high impedance inputs are not taken into account. Fourth, when the gate of a NMOS is +1, as well as one of its source and drain is 0, the element of 𝑆𝑉 for the terminal with 0 is modified by the voltage value of the other terminal. This operation is also applied to source and drain terminals of a PMOS in the same way when its gate is asserted with −1. Fifth, updated values at terminals of CMOS transistors are propagated to their connected elements in 𝑆𝑉 according to CM. Sixth, until there is no change in 𝑆𝑉, the fourth and fifth steps are repeated. However, when source and drain are assigned at opposite polarities to each other or both are set to 0, corresponding elements of 𝑆𝑉 are maintained without any changes. Finally, the output is obtained from the 𝑆𝑉 element of its connected terminal. Only when verification outputs for all input combinations are matched to the target outputs of the truth table, 𝑟𝑡 is given as +1. If not, 𝑟𝑡
is determined as −1. The verification steps for the case of an inverter are illustrated in Figure 7.
Figure 7. Verification steps for an inverter. Since outputs for all inputs (𝐼𝑁
) are matched to target outputs (𝑂𝑈𝑇), 𝑟𝑡
is decided as +1. 
2.4. Action (𝑎𝑡
)
The agent decides 𝑎𝑡
based on 𝑆𝑡 and 𝑀𝑡 received from the environment. 𝑎𝑡 contains the position of a new connection in the dimension of 𝑆𝑡
that is converted into a position of the upper right part of CM by the environment. Then, CM is updated by setting the corresponding element to 1. However, as mentioned in the mask generation, when a row and a column including that connection get multiple 1s, all combinations of those nodes should be directly connected to each other. Finally, the logical OR operation is conducted with CM and its transposed one, resulting in the symmetric matrix.
The agent is implemented by a deep Q-network (DQN) [29] that is composed of 4 fully connected networks (𝑓𝑐1
, 𝑓𝑐2, 𝑓𝑐3, 𝑓𝑐4). It takes the concatenation of 𝑆𝑡 and T as the input layer (X) as presented in Figure 8. T is the flattened vector of a given truth table. The range of the 𝑆𝑡 values is changed into from −1 to +1 to become equivalent to that of T. Activation functions are rectified linear units (ReLUs) for 𝑓𝑐1, 𝑓𝑐2, and 𝑓𝑐3, and a linear unit for 𝑓𝑐4. In particular, the multiplication of a mask and a large scalar (𝛽) is subtracted from the output layer of 𝑓𝑐4, guaranteeing that positions corresponding to mask elements of 1 are not available for the action selection. 𝑎𝑡 is decided by selecting the position of the maximum output through an argmax function with respect to actions. The overall network operations are described in Equations (6)–(11). 𝑊1, 𝑊2, 𝑊3, and 𝑊4 are weight matrices, and 𝑏1, 𝑏2, 𝑏3, and 𝑏4 are biases.

Figure 8. DQN structure. It deals with the concatenation of 𝑆𝑡
and T as an input layer. The range of 𝑆𝑡
elements from 0 to 1 is extended from −1 to +1 in order to be matched to T. 
An episode for a given T starts with an empty CM and continues until the working schematic is extracted or there are no more available connections. Every step (t) in the episode, the episode buffer stores a transition that contains 𝑆𝑡
, T, 𝑎𝑡, and 𝑟𝑡+1. Then, when the episode is terminated, the return (𝐺𝑡) at 𝑆𝑡 and T is computed, and the revised transition, where 𝑟𝑡+1 is replaced with 𝐺𝑡, is appended to a replay buffer. These episodes are repeated by changing T to address all target logic gates. Then, the agent’s DQN is trained based on mini-batches sampled from a replay buffer to minimize a loss (L) described in Equation (12). This is summarized in Algorithm 1, where Q is the DQN function, W is weights and biases, 𝛾 is the discounting factor, and 𝛼 is the learning rate.

3. Experimental Results
The GateRL is trained for the target logic gates, such as buffer, inverter, AND, NAND, OR, and NOR. While buffer and inverter are one-input logic gates, AND, NAND, OR, and NOR are two-input ones. Therefore, CM is set with 𝑁𝑖
, 𝑁𝑜, 𝑁𝑛, and 𝑁𝑝 of 2, 1, 2, and 2, respectively. The resultant 𝑁𝐶𝑀 and 𝑁𝑠 are computed as 17 and 126. The multiplication factor for 𝑀𝑡, 𝛽, is 100. Especially, the truth tables of buffer and inverter are provided with two versions, where one input is used, and the other is a floating node. Truth tables for all target gates are illustrated in Figure 9, leading to flattened vectors (Ts) at the size of 12. BUF1 and INV1 are buffer and inverter that use 𝐼𝑁1 as an input, and BUF2 and INV2 are buffer and inverter which adopt 𝐼𝑁2
as an input.
Figure 9. Truth tables for target logic gates. While BUF1 and INV1 are buffer and inverter with an input of 𝐼𝑁1
, BUF2 and INV2 are buffer and inverter with an input of 𝐼𝑁2
. 
For the agent’s DQN, the numbers of units in 𝑓𝑐1
, 𝑓𝑐2, and 𝑓𝑐3 are assigned to twice as large as the dimensionality of X (𝑁𝑥) that is 138. The size of 𝑓𝑐4 is equal to 𝑁𝑠 of 126. An 𝜖-greedy method is adopted with the random action selection probability (𝜖) of 0.1. The discounting factor, 𝛾, is 0.95 and the network is optimized by Adam with a learning rate of 0.001. In addition, there exist 8 special replay buffers dedicated to target logic gates (S0RB for BUF1, S1RB for BUF2, S2RB for INV1, S3RB for INV2, S4RB for AND, S5RB for OR, S6RB for NAND, S7RB for NOR) that contain the transition (𝑆,𝑇,𝑀,𝑎,𝑅) histories terminated at the reward of +1 and one replay buffers (FRB) for the transitions with the failure where the episode is finished with the reward of −1. All the replay buffers store up to 1024 transitions. On top of multiple replay buffers, the probability of the target logic selection (𝑃𝑇) is adjusted to force the network to focus on the logic gate episodes with more failures, that is, more rewards of −1 at the termination. The network is evaluated at the greedy mode every 64 episodes and the number of extracted working schematics is counted separately for each target logic. Then, those counted values are processed by the Softmax function with the temperature of 0.01 and 𝑃𝑇 is obtained by Equation (13). 𝑆𝐶𝑁𝑇 is a vector of 8 elements that includes the counted values for target logic gates. 
𝑃𝑇=1−Softmax(0.01·𝑆𝐶𝑁𝑇)7.
(13) 
The numbers of extracted working schematics are plotted in Figure 10a,b for training and evaluation. An x-axis is indicated by the number of 𝑆𝐼𝑀
s where one 𝑆𝐼𝑀
is equal to 64 episodes. As expected, BUF1 and BUF2 begin to be extracted first, and then more complicated logics are obtained in the order of AND, OR, INV1, INV2, NAND, and NOR. Especially, because the counted values for BUF1 and BUF2 are much larger than others, their probabilities of the target logic selection are reduced in the training period, which is represented as their smaller slopes in Figure 10a.
Figure 10. Plots of the number of extracted working schematics for target logic gates. (a) Training. (b) Evaluation. 
The resultant schematics extracted by the proposed GateRL are presented in Figure 11. BUF1 and BUF2 are constructed by one transistor that is always turned on. Their episodes are terminated in 3 steps. AND and OR are proposed with two transistors, where one NMOS transistor is always on, and the other transistor is controlled by 𝐼𝑁1
. They are finished in 6 steps. When 𝐼𝑁1 is low and 𝐼𝑁2 is high for AND, the racing problem between 𝐼𝑁1 and 𝐼𝑁2 takes place; however, 𝑂𝑈𝑇
can be settled at the low level close to GND by increasing the ratio of channel width to channel length of a PMOS transistor (P1). The similar issue on the schematic of OR can be coped with by increasing the channel width-to-length ratio of a NMOS transistor (N2). INV1 and INV2 are composed of one PMOS transistor and one NMOS transistor, and their episodes are done in 6 steps. Lastly, NAND and NOR are built with three transistors (2 PMOS and 1 NMOS for NAND, 1 PMOS and 2 NMOS for NOR), and the episodes end in 9 steps. Like AND and OR, the extracted circuits of NAND and NOR can cause racing problems that would be addressed by manipulating the channel width-to-length ratio. Components and episode lengths of working schematics are summarized in Table 1.
Figure 11. Working schematics extracted by GateRL for target logic gates. 
Table 1. Training results for target logic gates. 
 
These extracted circuits are evaluated by the off-the-shelf circuit simulator, SPICE, as summarized in Figure 12. The proposed GateRL does not take into account threshold voltages of transistors and racing issues. Therefore, some circuits cannot achieve the rail to rail outputs, even though the channel width-to-length ratio is adjusted. While BUF1 pulls up 𝑂𝑈𝑇
to the lower voltage than VDD due to the threshold voltage of N1, BUF2 pulls down to the higher voltage than GND due to that of P1. In AND, OR, NAND, and NOR, lower logic-1 than VDD and higher logic-0 than GND are caused by threshold voltage and racing problem. However, all logic-1 and logic-0 voltages are accomplished at higher and lower levels than the center level, respectively. These issues will be further addressed in our future works by revising the verification algorithm for the reward and the network structures.
Figure 12. SPICE simulation results. 
To verify the necessity of separate replay buffers and adaptive 𝑃𝑇
, the GateRL is also trained and evaluated with a uniform 𝑃𝑇 or with only one replay buffer. As depicted in Figure 13a, the uniform 𝑃𝑇 and separate replay buffers cannot provide NOR schematics within 2000 𝑆𝐼𝑀s, and even other logic gates are extracted at the longer 𝑆𝐼𝑀s. In the case of one replay buffer, only BUF1 and BUF2 are designed within 2000 𝑆𝐼𝑀s, as illustrated in Figure 13b,c. Consequently, it is ensured that separate replay buffers can help to find solutions of complicated logic schematics, and the adaptive 𝑃𝑇
contributes to improve the training speed.

4. Conclusions
Although various ML algorithms have been employed in many applications, the area of an automated circuit design has not been addressed yet. This paper demonstrates the first ML approach that automatically designs the circuit schematics.
The proposed GateRL is an automated digital circuit design framework based on RL at the backplane of CMOS transistors. The connection of circuit elements is described by CM that is transferred in the format of a vector to the agent along with the mask. The mask is used to reduce the dimensionality of the action space. The agent decides the optimum action of a new connection by a DQN that consists of 4 fully connected network layers. The proposed GateRL is successfully trained with separate replay buffers and adaptive selection probability for 6 target logics, such as buffer, inverter, AND, OR, NAND, and NOR. The extracted schematics are verified by SPICE simulation.
However, the proposed scheme has some limitations. First, all transistors are taken into account as ideal switches by neglecting the threshold voltages. Therefore, the turned-on transistors are dealt with as perfect short circuits regardless of voltage levels at source and drain terminals. Second, some extracted circuits contain the racing problems. These are compensated for to some extent in the SPICE simulation by manipulating the channel width-to-length ratio. Third, only voltage sources and CMOS transistors are included as circuit elements. Even though these limitations, the proposed GateRL will pave the way to the complete ML frameworks of the schematic design over more complicated digital circuits, as well as analog circuits.

St Peace College Fees
To help you understand the fees at St Peace College, let’s start with something called Quantile levels. It’s like a special way the government decides how much money (in South African Rands -ZAR) to give to public schools towards providing free education. As per the South African Schools Act (SASA), all School Governing Bodies (SGBs) in public schools have to add extra money to the government funding by asking parents to pay school fees and doing other fundraising activities. However, there are some schools called ‘no fee schools’ that don’t charge any fees. Whether a school is considered a “no fee school” depends on how well-off the community around the school is economically. 
1.	Which Quantile is St Peace College: 
2.	Is St Peace College a NO-FEE school: No
3.	Is St Peace College a public or independent: Independent
So, for each student, the government will pay: 
•	Quantile 1: R1,177
•	Quantile 2: R1,177
•	Quantile 3: R1,177
•	Quantile 4: R590
•	Quantile 5: R204
Sometimes, the money the government gives to schools based on their quantile levels isn’t enough, especially for schools with higher quantiles. These schools are often independent schools. So, to cover their costs, schools need to find other ways to get money. They rely on things like donations from people who want to help and fees that students’ families pay. This money helps the schools pay for things like buildings, supplies, and other expenses to keep the school running smoothly. Read more about school fees exemption. 
Fees Discount
Plenty of Independent schools often aim to lessen the financial burden on parents. One way they do this is by offering discounts to those who choose to pay the entire year’s fees upfront. These discounts can range from 3% to 10%, which can be quite helpful. Moreover, parents who have multiple children attending the school can request sibling discounts of up to 10%, further easing the costs for families with more than one dependent. 
Application  Form/Process
Fortunately St Peace College application forms are very welcoming and can be reached out to directly from the school, where they will provide you with an application form and guide you through what else is needed to support an enrolment. howtoprivate 
St Peace College Stationery list
If you can’t find the school supply lists here, don’t worry! It’s probably because your grade’s teacher has the list or it is included to the fees. To make things easier, you can order your stationery online. Just visit www.onlinestationery.co.za and upload the stationery list for St Peace College including the grade for your child. They will deliver the supplies right to your doorstep or to the school, giving you peace of mind and added convenience. 
Hair policy
In general, the school’s hair policy asks that it be kept neat and well-maintained, with short, neutral styles for males. For females, descent afros are permitted, with extensions also allowed for females, if they are natural in colour and tied up, pleated, or bound neatly. Hair coverings or wigs are allowed only for medical or religious reasons. 
Staff & Teachers List
The progress of each student is monitored and facilitated by an expert academic empowerment team and well-educated teachers. The staff are committed to provide an inclusive and high-quality learning experience and openly welcome all interest and applications. The school’s staff is led by head teacher/principal: . A full list of teaching and admin staff coming soon.

Simulation Lab
The Simulation Lab is a safe learning environment that fosters a culture of innovative, collaborative learning through clinical simulation. This is a space where staff can learn the practice of simulation teaching to develop graduate outcomes for their students such as teamwork, communication, decision-making, and critical thinking skills, and enhance students’ clinical reasoning.
Simulation is  defined as an activity/task that produces an experience for an individual without going through a real-life event. In health sciences, education simulation is used for patient interactions through role-playing, clinical scenarios, procedures as well as team-based activities such as care of in-patients, a complete resuscitation scenario etc. The aim of simulation teaching is to develop competent reflective practitioners through experiencing structured scenarios and debriefing sessions. The Sim Lab’s video capacity allows for this structured debriefing for all simulations which promotes the development of habitual reflection on personal practice..
The Simulation Lab coordinator can assist with the inclusion of simulation teaching within a curriculum, creating specific simulation scenarios and setting up the environment to best meet the learning objectives of the session. The Simulation coordinator can also develop and facilitate the sessions as needed by the teaching team.
The Simulation lab is located on the 4th Floor in the Health Sciences Building, see room 4B24.

Important Definitions 
Simulation-based education: Simulation-based education (SBE) is increasingly used to help learners and health professionals develop their knowledge, skills and behaviours, particularly around clinical skills and procedures (although SBE is wider than simple procedures). The simulation pedagogy allows students to develop their critical thinking and clinical reasoning skills in a safe simulated environment through structured experience and effective feedback and debriefing techniques. Simulation-based education also allows for inter-departmental collaborations to take place to foster a culture of interprofessional learning.
Simulation Laboratory: A simulation laboratory is strategically designed to serve the purpose of simulation-based education. The simulation lab may be designed in various ways so that it may best allow for the event/activity to produce and mimic a real experience. The simulation lab aims to provide a safe space for various scenarios to be played out to meet specific learning objectives. This space prevents unsafe practice and harm to patients and aims to improve the healthcare system and healthcare for patients through structured scenarios and debriefing techniques.
Fidelity and technology: Fidelity is commonly used to describe how life like a simulation is. Technology refers to manikin capabilities, eg: high technology manikins refer to how life-like the manikin can be e.g.: SimMan, SuperTory. Low technology manikin refers to the manikin without any enhanced features or built-in feedback mechanisms e.g.: Pap smear manikin, airway manikin. A high-fidelity simulation may have a low technology manikin but will be high fidelity due to the simulation scenario, role playing and feedback opportunities.
Task Training: Task-oriented training involves practising real-life tasks, with the intention of acquiring or reacquiring a skill. These skills may not require any element of simulation pedagogies or teaching tools.
Simulation Laboratory capabilities

Types of Qualitative research designs
Qualitative Methodology
Grounded theory, ethnographic, narrative research, historical, case studies, and phenomenology are several types of qualitative research designs.  The proceeding paragraphs give a brief over view several of these qualitative methods.
Grounded theory is a systematic procedure of data analysis, typically associated with qualitative research, that allows researchers to develop a theory that explains a specific phenomenon.  Grounded theory was developed by Glaser and Strauss and is used to conceptualize phenomenon using research; grounded theory is not seen as a descriptive method and originates from sociology.  The unit of analysis in grounded theory is a specific phenomenon or incident, not individual behaviors.   The primary data collection method is through interviews of approximately 20 – 30 participants or until data achieves saturation.
Ethnographic studies are qualitative procedures utilized to describe, analyze and interpret a culture’s characteristics.  Ethnography was developed in the 19thand 20th centuries and used by anthropologists to explore primitive cultures different from their own; it originated from Anthropology.  Ethnography is used when a researcher wants to study a group of people to gain a larger understanding of their lives or specific aspects of their lives.  The primary data collection method is through observation over an extended period of time.  It would also be appropriate to interview others who have studied the same cultures.
Phenomenology is used to identify phenomena and focus on subjective experiences and understanding the structure of those lived experiences.  It was founded in the early 20th century by Edmund Husserl and Martin Heideggar and originated from philosophy.  Phenomenology is used to describe, in depth, the common characteristics of the phenomena that has occurred.   The primary data collection method is through in-depth interviews.
Case studies are believed to have originated in 1829 by Frederic Le Play.  Case studies are rooted in several disciplines, including science, education, medicine, and law.  Case studies are to be used when (1) the researcher wants to focus on how and why, (2) the behavior is to be observed, not manipulated, (3) to further understand a given phenomenon, and (4) if the boundaries between the context and phenomena are not clear.  Multiple methods can be used to gather data, including interviews, observation, and historical documentation.

Any business that keeps records and requires data storage can employ a documentation technician to organize and ensure the security of information. These professionals use a range of new technologies to store data, including hard drives and cloud storage.Documentation technicians have a range of responsibilities and may handle physical records and develop methods for organizing them for easy access. Others might work in an IT environment and help preserve data and electronic records. Technicians might be responsible for choosing storage methods, filing systems, and effective security measures. They use skills such as organization, attention to detail, and communication to succeed in their work. Additionally, they might use different job titles, such as document specialist or records technician.Related: What Is Project Documentation and Why Is It Important?
How to become a documentation technician?
Learning how to become a documentation technician typically involves gaining certifications and experience in this discipline. Some jobs might require a specialized degree, but many positions offer opportunities to those with the right combination of skills and experience. Consider the following steps for entering the profession:
1. Research positions
Before you start pursuing a documentation technician role, it's helpful to research different positions and determine the qualifications for each one. For example, a document technician in the medical sector might require different qualifications than one handling police records. Consider your interests and the available positions and try to determine which job matches your goals. You can read the job description to see what kind of certifications and experience the employer requires to improve your chances of getting a job.Related: What Does a Document Controller Do? (With Skills and Duties)
2. Consider a degree or certification
A degree or certification can be beneficial. Working as a technician doesn't require a specific degree, but many degrees and certifications can teach you useful skills for the profession. Consider pursuing a degree in subjects such as information science or health information science. If you hope to work as a technician in the legal sector, you might pursue a legal assistant diploma or degree. You may also consider a clinical documentation specialist certification for working in the medical industry.Related: A Guide to Administrative Certifications (With Examples)
3. Develop your skills and experience
Many technician positions require specific skills, such as attention to detail, organization, and knowledge of software programs. Developing these skills through work, volunteering, or education can help you qualify for open positions. Try to research specific documentation technician roles and determine key skills that employers look for. Pursue jobs where you can develop these abilities and learn how to handle documents. Working in office administration, as a filing clerk, or as a library assistant can provide valuable experience that may lead to a documentation technician role.
Primary duties of documentation technicians
Documentation technicians perform a range of duties. Here are some of their common tasks:
Collecting records
Documentation technicians collect records for an organization and store them in appropriate locations for future access. They might assist with gathering records from relevant departments, developing procedures for transferring records to storage, and ensuring all relevant information reaches the correct destination for storage. They work with colleagues, such as secretaries and clerks, to track relevant records, determine a system for categorizing them, and arrange them in ways that allow access to them by others.
Cataloging data
Technicians develop systems for cataloging data to keep it organized and allow efficient access. They may determine appropriate storage methods for both physical files and digital data, develop systems for organizing the files logically, and create protocols for accessing files. Technicians might decide to organize certain files, such as patient records, alphabetically, or organize business data by date created. They consider how others might use the files in the future and strive to create systems that make it easy for interested parties to find relevant information.
Securing documents
Documentation technicians consider the security of the files in their care and determine methods for preserving records from unexpected events. They might decide to make backup copies of physical records and store them in multiple locations for security. They can take measures to prevent damage by natural elements or human error. For digital data, technicians might make backup copies and regularly update storage methods to take advantage of new technologies. They might preserve some files using password-protected cloud storage and keep others on external hard drives.
Assisting with requests
Technicians respond to requests from team members and other interested parties and help with document recovery. They might receive a request for a specific document and use their knowledge of the filing system to retrieve it. Technicians might also devise systems for determining who can access specific records and create online portals for sharing information. They also help establish procedures for accessing documents, prevent unauthorized requests, and help people search for important information and develop systems to ensure access.

Key skills for documentation technicians
Documentation technicians use a range of skills. Here are some important skills for technicians:
Organization
Organization skills help documentation technicians arrange files logically and develop systems that make sense to other users. They often handle large numbers of files or amounts of data, so organization is important for sorting the information into manageable sections. These professionals develop plans for organizing files, implement systems for grouping similar documents, and continually maintain order in the system. They might identify out-of-place files and move them back to their correct location, find lost documents, and advise others on plans for organizing information.Related: Developing Proficient Organizational Skills
Attention to detail
Attention to detail allows documentation technicians to place each file in the correct location and respond to requests for file access. Technicians use attention to detail to remember the location of specific files and help others find useful information. Documentation technicians strive to place each file in a logical location and develop systems that help them notice and correct small errors. Attention to detail also helps technicians keep data safe and remember to make backups of all valuable files.Related: Attention to Detail
Analytical thinking
They use analytical thinking to develop filing systems and make sound data storage and access decisions. Technicians often set up filing systems that preserve important records and make them available for access. They also use analytical thinking to consider organization requirements, data preservation, and access methods as they set up a filing system. Analytical thinking helps technicians determine protocols for maintaining data security and who can access specific files.
Communication
Communication skills allow documentation technicians to collaborate with other team members and explain their methods concerning filing systems and data security. They might create presentations or documentation explaining their filing system to help others use it to access information. They take instruction from company management on data security and filing procedures and design systems that meet requirements. Communication skills allow documentation technicians to listen to requests from others and help them search through records to find relevant information.
Technical knowledge
Documentation technicians use technical knowledge to work with specialized data storage systems, duplicate files, and share information. Technicians assess different filing systems and technologies and decide on approaches that ensure security and meet organizational goals. Technical knowledge allows them to use specialized software and storage systems to secure files and search through them for specific documents.

How to Become a Help Desk Technician in 3 Steps
Written by Coursera Staff • Updated on Jan 31, 2024
Learn about the essential skills you'll need to become a help desk technician, as well as what it takes to qualify for these roles.

What is a help desk technician?
Help desk technicians are specialized types of customer service representatives. They use their technical knowledge of hardware and software to help troubleshoot problems users encounter. Beyond that technical proficiency, they must also have excellent interpersonal skills to interact with customers. 
If you enjoy working with people and technology, this position could be a great fit for you. Read on to learn more about help desk technicians and how you can become one. 
What does a help desk technician do?
A help desk technician is an information technology (IT) professional who assists customers in navigating technology properly. This can include: 
•	Responding to customer support inquiries and documenting feedback from customers 
•	Helping customers troubleshoot technical problems such as network issues in person or remotely
•	Offering technical assistance to users regarding the configuration, setup, and maintenance of products
•	Redirecting unresolved issues to the appropriate teams
•	Maintaining documentation of problems and processes
•	Training end-users in security practices
In the United States, 48 percent of help desk specialists have a bachelor’s degree, and 35 percent have an associate degree [1]. An example of a relevant degree for an aspiring help desk technician to pursue is a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. 
Essential skills for help desk technicians
Someone in a customer support role must possess workplace skills (also known as soft skills or interpersonal skills) in addition to their technical skills. The checklist below outlines a few of the most important skills from each category:
•	Strong understanding of operating systems, software, and devices
•	Familiarity with cloud computing
•	Network administration

While help desk technicians overlap in some ways with titles like IT support technician, they are ultimately not the same. IT support focuses on providing technical assistance for complex product issues. Someone in a help desk support role, on the other hand, is likely to help users resolve more straightforward matters, such as a forgotten password. They may escalate complicated technical problems like faulty products to IT support.
How much does a help desk technician make?
In the US, help desk technicians earn a base salary of $48,310 and $2,555 in additional pay per year on average [2]. Additional pay may include profit-sharing, commissions, or bonuses. Factors that can influence your salary in this role include experience, education level, industry, location, and company. 
Job outlook for help desk support positions
Help desk technicians belong to the occupational field of computer support specialists. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) projects 5 percent job growth for careers in this field between 2022 and 2032 [3]. Those interested in working in IT can get their start as a help desk technician before acquiring the skills to pursue more specialized roles.
